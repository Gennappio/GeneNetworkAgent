## Detailed Analysis Results

## 📝 Network Loader
**Network Successfully Loaded**: Simple Good Network

**Network Composition:**
- **Total Nodes**: 9
- **Input Nodes**: 2 (external signals/conditions)
- **Logic Nodes**: 7 (internal regulatory elements)

**Loading Assessment:**
The network file was successfully parsed and loaded. The network contains 9 regulatory elements, which suggests a moderate regulatory system.

The presence of 2 input nodes indicates the network can respond to 2 external signals, while 7 internal nodes suggest moderate internal regulatory logic.

## 🔍 Topology Analyzer
**Topology Analysis Results**

**Network Structure:**
- **Nodes**: 9 regulatory elements
- **Edges**: 0 regulatory interactions
- **Density**: 0.000 (sparsely connected)
- **Connectivity**: Disconnected components detected

**Regulatory Architecture:**
- **Feedback Loops**: 0 cycles detected (lacks feedback loops)
- **Modularity**: 9 strongly connected components (highly modular)

**Topological Assessment:**
The network shows limited regulatory complexity. Low connectivity may indicate missing regulatory relationships or a simplified model.

⚠️ **Disconnected components detected** - some regulatory elements may be isolated.

**Implications for Dynamics**: Simple dynamics likely due to limited connectivity.
## ⚡ Dynamics Analyzer
**Dynamics Analysis Results**

**Attractor Landscape:**
- **Attractors Found**: 6 stable states (complex dynamics)
- **Oscillations**: Detected (dynamic regulatory cycles)

**Network Stability:**
- **Unstable Nodes**: 7 out of 9 nodes
- **Stability Assessment**: Unstable
- **Sensitive Elements**: Proliferation, p21, BCL2, p53, Growth_Arrest...

**Dynamical Assessment:**
The network exhibits rich dynamical behavior with 6 distinct stable states.

⚠️ **High instability detected** - many nodes show sensitive behavior to perturbations.

🔄 **Oscillatory behavior detected** - suggests active regulatory cycles and temporal dynamics.

**Biological Implications**: Complex multi-stable behavior suggests the network can adopt multiple functional states, potentially corresponding to different cellular phenotypes.
